# A collection of ImageJ macros for microscopy images

## White balance.ijm
ImageJ macro for setting white balance of brightfield microscopy images - dark object on a white background. A small area of background needs to be selected before running the macro. This is a modification of a macro by Vytas Bindokas (2006) & Patrice Mascalchi (2014).

## WB-modes.ijm
An attempt to automatically correct white balance by using the modes of the RGB histograms. Works well in brightfield microscopy images with a large background area.

## EqualizeStack.ijm
Normalize brightness of all slices in a stack to the same value. Used this for fluorescence Z-stacks.
